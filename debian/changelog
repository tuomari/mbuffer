mbuffer (20091227-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - remove the 05-kfreebsd and 06-signal patches, integrated upstream
    - reintroduce the 02-test-cleanup patch, since the upstream Makefile
      needs to be portable and may not afford to use ?=
    - remove the explicit -lrt, upstream links against it now
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4 with no changes.
  * Add the 07-manpage patch to fix a couple of typos and grammar nits
    in the manual page; forwarded upstream, the author accepted it for
    the next upstream release.

  * Fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD.  Closes: #560750
  * Honor upstream's preference for libmhash and drop the GnuTLS patch.
    Pointed out by: Mats Erik Andersson <mats.andersson@gisladisker.se>
  * New upstream version:
    - integrate the test suite and the hstrerror -lresolv patches
    - honor the user's CFLAGS, so no need for the CFLAGS patch
    - link with -lrt for clock_gettime(3) and friends
    - portability fixes: read a monotonic clock, make IPv6 really optional,
      check the input device's block size
  * Fix a segfault when terminating in quiet mode.  Closes: #562112.
