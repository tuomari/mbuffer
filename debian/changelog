mbuffer (20140310-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Use dh-autoreconf *and* autotools-dev so that config.sub/guess are
    still updated, even as the package doesn't use automake.
    Thanks to Peter Michael Green <plugwash@debian.org>.
    Closes: #766734.

mbuffer (20140310-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix the watch file: support both absolute and relative links.
  * Remove the obsolete DM-Upload-Allowed source control field.
  * Bump the debhelper compatibility version to 9:
    - get the build hardening flags directly from debhelper
    - drop the dpkg-dev versioned dependency (for dpkg-buildflags),
      long satisfied even in oldstable
  * Drop the version in the autotools-dev build dependency.
  * Drop the source compression options; dpkg-dev's defaults are good enough.
  * Switch the copyright file to the final version of the 1.0 specification
    and bump the year of my debian/* copyright notice.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.6 with no changes.
  * Mark the binary package as Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Add a debian/upstream/metadata file.
  * Switch the Vcs-* fields to the full-source Git repository.
  * New upstream release:
    - add the 10-manpage-dashes patch to mark dashes up properly
    - add the 11-typos patch to fix some grammar and typographical nits
    - add the 12-path-max patch to determine the max path length
      on the fly, e.g. for the Hurd where there is no PATH_MAX
    - add the 13-off-by-one patch to fix an off-by-one memory allocation
    - update the upstream copyright years
  * Use dh-autoreconf instead of autotools-dev to also regenerate
    the configure script and friends.  Add the 14-autoconf patch to
    update the configure.in template and to fix some fallout.

mbuffer (20110119-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the watchfile: the upstream download page's URLs are fully
    qualified now.
  * Fix the FTBFS on GNU/Hurd by trying fpathconf() before PIPE_BUF and
    checking for several more constants if that fails.
  * Update the copyright file to the latest DEP 5 candidate format and
    add the GPL-3+ license in the header, too, just in case.
  * Upload to unstable.

  * New upstream release.
  * Use dpkg-buildflags from dpkg-dev >= 1.15.7~ to obtain CFLAGS and
    CPPFLAGS and to add -Wl,-z,defs to LDFLAGS; no longer rely on
    dpkg-buildpackage to export the flags variables automatically.

mbuffer (20091227-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - remove the 05-kfreebsd and 06-signal patches, integrated upstream
    - reintroduce the 02-test-cleanup patch, since the upstream Makefile
      needs to be portable and may not afford to use ?=
    - remove the explicit -lrt, upstream links against it now
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4 with no changes.
  * Add the 07-manpage patch to fix a couple of typos and grammar nits
    in the manual page; forwarded upstream, the author accepted it for
    the next upstream release.
